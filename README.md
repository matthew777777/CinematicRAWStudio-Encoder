# Cinematic RAW Studio — Encoder

C++20 lossless encoder and streaming container writer for `.CRAW`
(spec: `../CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/SPEC.md`). Apache-2.0. Used by the RawLens
Android app through JNI (vendored with `tools/sync_craw.sh` in RawLens).

## Easy install: Mac, Linux and Windows

Install the complete toolset once with the
[shared installer](https://github.com/matthew777777/CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/blob/main/GETTING_STARTED.md).
It fetches the sibling repos and dependencies automatically.

Mac/Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthew777777/CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
& ([scriptblock]::Create((irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthew777777/CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/main/scripts/install.ps1)))
```

Open a new terminal, then use `craw` for the editor,
`craw mount "take.craw"` for Resolve, `craw unmount` to close mounts,
or `craw export "take.craw"` to save CinemaDNG and sound.


## Build

```
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja && ninja -C build
./build/craw_enc_conformance          # byte-exact against the Python reference vectors
./build/craw_bench --bits 12          # 4080x3060 throughput, JSON
scripts/build_android.sh              # Release arm64-v8a with the newest NDK
```
End users can use the shared installer above; the build commands are for developers.

## API

```cpp
#include <craw/Writer.h>

craw::Writer w("take.craw", metaJson);               // META chunk (SPEC.md §2)
craw::FrameDesc d{4080, 3060, 12, craw::Cfa::RGGB};  // width, height, bit depth, CFA
w.addFrame(raw16, strideSamples, d, timestampNs, frameJson);
w.addAudio(ts, craw::AudioFormat::F32, 2, 48000, samples, frames);
w.addImu(craw::ImuSensor::Gyroscope, samples, count);
w.addShading(ts, id, columns, rows, gains);          // frames reference it with "lshd_ref"
w.close();                                           // INDX + trailer
```

Encode on worker threads and commit in order (what RawLens does):
```cpp
size_t n = craw::encodeFrame(raw16, stride, d, dst, capacity);  // any thread, into your buffer
w.addEncodedFrame(dst, n, timestampNs, frameJson);              // committer thread, no copy
```
For current RawLens Live capture, `d.codec = 3` selects CRAW-Live v2.
Codec 2 is the older Live v1; codec 1 (CRAW-Fast) trades CPU for potentially
smaller payloads. The size ordering depends on the scene; “Fast” is a
historical name, not a claim that it outpaces Live. All preserve every RAW sample.
With any mode,
`d.frameCrc = false` avoids a raw-frame checksum pass when the payload is
written into a CRC32C-protected CRAW container. Readers must verify that
chunk CRC; standalone payloads then have no checksum.

The caller-buffer overload with one thread streams tiles into the supplied
buffer and retains only one tile of workspace. This limits memory pressure
when several recorder workers encode full-resolution frames concurrently.

`encodeFrame(..., threads)` also splits one frame over tiles. A sample above
`2^bitDepth` throws `std::invalid_argument` (RawLens retries at 16 bits).

## Tools

| tool | usage |
|------|-------|
| `craw_enc` | `craw_enc out.craw --width W --height H --bits B [--cfa RGGB] [--fps 30] [--meta meta.json] f0.raw f1.raw …` (uint16 LE frames; `fN.json` sidecars become frame JSON) |
| `craw_bench` | `craw_bench [--input frame.raw --width W --height H] [--bits 12] [--frames 30] [--threads N] [--tile 128] [--codec 1|2|3|4] [--frame-crc 0|1] [--direct 0|1]` |

## Performance

ARM NEON for plane extraction, MED residuals and block sums; four Rice code
words per 32-bit write; parallel frame CRC (CRC32C combine); zero-copy writes.
Historical MT6878 reports quote ~650 MPix/s with 8 threads and 653–700 MPix/s
through the JNI path. Exact original run output for those claims is not attached;
they do not establish sustained camera-to-storage fps.

The shared [benchmark guide](https://github.com/matthew777777/CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/blob/main/BENCHMARKS.md)
defines codec IDs, evidence limits and the reproducible CRAW/JPEG XL comparison.
The [comparison driver](https://github.com/matthew777777/CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/tree/main/bench/comparison)
measures identical RAW samples, size, encode/decode wall and CPU time, process
peak RSS and sustained isolated phone loops. Results are separate from capture
acceptance. [2026-10-30 results](https://github.com/matthew777777/CinematicRAWStudio-Spec/tree/main/results/comparison-20261030).

## Desktop Compact

Set `FrameDesc::codec = 4` (or `craw_enc --codec 4`) for Desktop Compact.
It searches four predictors per tile and explicit per-block Rice parameters;
output is deterministic across thread counts. Codecs 1–3 retain their exact
wire output. Codec 4 uses no external entropy library. This trades CPU for
smaller archives and is substantially slower than Live v2. To re-encode an
existing take while retaining its metadata and ancillary chunks, build the
sibling Decoder tools and use `craw compact in.craw out.craw`.
